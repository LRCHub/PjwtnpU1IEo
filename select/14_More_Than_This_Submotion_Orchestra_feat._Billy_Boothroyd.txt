Next year,
Maybe,
I'll be more than this.
Till then
I'll try
To find what comfort is.

I'll go,
Too slow,
And see what I can see.
Up here
All clear
Is this what imagine means?

Give me your hand, give me your heart.

Should we
Complete
What has come so far?
Quit now
Leave town
And make another start?

Can't lie,
Too tired,
You're the same as me.
Thank God,
Finally,
Something we agree on.

Give me your hand, give me your heart.
