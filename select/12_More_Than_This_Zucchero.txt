Babe I still feel
You are my life
Don't you believe me?
Love lives tonight

Turn and surrender
Call out my name
Take me to nowhere
I'm willing to learn

More than ever
Feel good,
Hope For...
Love

Turn around serene
Crawl in my light
Won't you reveal to me
How loves lives tonight?

More than this
I feel your breathing
More than ever
Feel good,
Hope for...
Love

Al Caldo del sole
Al mare scendeva
La bambina Portoghese
Non c'eran parole
Rumori soltanto
Come voci sorprese

Ohhh...
More than this
I feel your breathing...
More, more than ever
Feel good,
Hope for...
Love
