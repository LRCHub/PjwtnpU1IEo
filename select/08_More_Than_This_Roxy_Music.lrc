[00:14.48] I could feel at the time
[00:18.15] There was no way of knowing
[00:21.95] Fallen leaves in the night
[00:25.60] Who can say where they're blowing?
[00:42.60] 
[00:30.34] As free as the wind
[00:34.02] Hopefully learning
[00:37.50] Why the sea on the tide
[00:41.35] Has no way of turning
[00:51.85] 
[00:48.13] More than this
[00:51.73] You know there's nothing
[00:55.44] More than this
[00:59.08] Tell me one thing
[01:02.94] More than this
[01:06.98] Ooh there's nothing
[01:16.48] 
[01:18.24] It was fun for a while
[01:21.15] There was no way of knowing
[01:25.59] Like a dream in the night
[01:29.20] Who can say where we're going?
[01:44.20] 
[01:33.06] No care in the world
[01:37.94] Maybe I'm learning
[01:40.61] Why the sea on the tide
[01:45.24] Has no way of turning
[01:55.74] 
[01:51.86] More than this
[01:55.06] You know there's nothing
[01:58.96] More than this
[02:02.30] Tell me one thing
[02:06.26] More than this
[02:10.81] No there's nothing
[02:19.81] 
[02:21.40] More than this
[02:25.76] Nothing
[02:28.99] More than this
[02:36.47] More than this
[02:41.43] Nothing
