[01:47.75] For a second of your life
[01:51.68] Tell me that it's true
[01:54.50] Waiting for a sign
[01:57.06] It's all I want of you
[01:59.94] Your heart hides a secret
[02:02.75] A promise of what is
[02:05.84] Something more than this
[02:17.84] 
[02:10.85] Just a second of your time
[02:14.49] Anyone will do
[02:17.25] A taste of any other
[02:19.81] Is all I want from you
[02:22.97] Offer me the world
[02:25.53] And how can I resist
[02:28.63] Something more than this
[02:40.63] 
[02:34.14] Make believe in magic
[02:37.27] Make believe in dreams
[02:40.38] Make believe impossible
[02:42.99] Nothing as it seems
[02:45.78] See, touch, taste, smell, hear
[02:49.12] But never know if it's real (but never know if it's real)
[03:17.62] 
[02:56.33] For a second of your life
[02:59.98] Tell me if it's true
[03:02.88] Anywhere we are
[03:05.40] It's all I want of you
[03:08.50] Your lips lies a secret
[03:11.47] A promise of a kiss
[03:14.24] Of something more than this
[03:27.74] 
[03:48.07] Just a second of your time
[03:51.32] Anyone will do
[03:54.25] To know any other
[03:57.15] Is all I want from you
[04:00.29] Giving me the world
[04:02.87] Now I can't resist
[04:05.76] Something more than this
[04:17.76] 
[04:11.48] Make believe in magic
[04:14.26] Make believe in dreams
[04:17.32] Make believe impossible
[04:20.21] Nothing as it seems
[04:23.05] Never really understand
[04:26.94] What anything means (what anything means)
[04:47.44] 
[04:33.49] Another second of my life
[04:36.86] Not knowing if it's true
[04:40.20] Make believe in nothing
[04:42.72] Is all I want of you
[04:46.18] Whisper me a secret
[04:48.74] Whisper me there is
[04:51.58] Always something other
[04:54.46] Something more than this
