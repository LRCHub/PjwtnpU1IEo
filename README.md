[00:10.23] I could feel at the time
[00:15.78] There was no way of knowing
[00:19.57] Fallen leaves in the night
[00:23.45] Who can say where they're blowing
[00:27.09] As free as the wind
[00:32.13] Hopefully learning
[00:34.77] Why the sea on the tide
[00:37.96] Has no way of turning
[00:48.46] 
[00:46.75] More than this
[00:50.83] You know there's nothing
[00:55.45] More than this
[00:59.74] Tell me one thing
[01:03.40] More than this
[01:07.36] You know there's nothing
[01:19.36] 
[01:18.97] It was fun for a while
[01:22.91] There was no way of knowing
[01:27.28] Like a dream in the night
[01:30.75] Who can say where we're going
[01:34.81] No care in the world
[01:39.43] Maybe I'm learning
[01:42.41] Why the sea on the tide
[01:46.67] Has no way of turning
[01:57.17] 
[01:55.19] More than this
[01:58.79] You know there's nothing
[02:03.39] More than this
[02:07.42] Tell me one thing
[02:10.63] More than this
[02:14.58] You know there is nothing
[02:27.08] 
[02:21.05] Oooh aaaah
[02:26.94] More than this
[02:29.70] You know there's nothing
[02:34.49] More than this
[02:38.42] Tell me one thing
[02:42.18] More than this
[02:46.45] There's nothing
[02:51.42] Ooooh ooooh ooooooh aaaaaaah ooooooh
