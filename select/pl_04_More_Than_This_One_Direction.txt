At this rate
I’m not gonna have bridesmaids
Haven’t seen my friends in
seventeen Fridays
Spending all my time on you
At this rate,
I should throw away my crop tops
Wear your hoodies cause you say
I make em look hot
Are you all I’m ever gonna do
Never really been the kinda
girl to throw a fit
Lately, I’ve been wondering
if this is really it
My girls have all been asking
where I think this thing will go
How we getting married
when we never leave your home
All we еver do is
hang out,make out,
order up too much takе out
Watch the same damn movies,
drink some mango truly’s
All we ever do is stay in,
sleep in, why go out
when you’re three in
Damn I’m getting bored of this,
tell me that there’s more than
this, more than this
Now tell me,
are you sure you’re happy
Frozen dinners on your birthday
ain’t it classy
Good as we’re gonna get
So tell me,
is this what you wanted
Are you having fun yet
(are you having fun yet)
At this rate we’re dying
in your basement,
no way to escape it
We’re both stuck but
you and I are never gonna say it
Awkward conversations,
love you but I hate this
All we ever do is
hang out, make out,
order up too much take out
Watch the same damn movies,
drink some mango truly’s
All we ever do is stay in,
sleep in, why go out
when you’re three in
Damn I’m getting bored of this,
tell me that there’s more than
this, more than this
Tell me there’s more
(tell me there’s more)
Tell me there’s more
(tell me there’s more)
More than this,
tell me there’s more to this
Never really been the kinda
girl to throw a fit
Lately, I’ve been wondering if
this is really it
All we ever do is hang out
all we ever do
all we ever do
All we ever do is hang out
all we ever do
All we ever do is
hang out, make out,
order up too much take out
Watch the same damn movies,
drink some mango truly’s
All we ever do is stay in,
sleep in, why go out
when you’re three in
Damn I’m getting bored of this,
tell me that there’s more than
this, more than this
Tell me there’s more
(tell me there’s more)
Tell me there’s more
(tell me there’s more)
More than this,
tell me there’s more to this
