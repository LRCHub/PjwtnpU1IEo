Yeah, we could have made up
Yeah, we should have stayed up
tryna fix you and me
But all that
I know is coulda/shoulda
just don't mean a goddamn thing
Looking at you, I realise
Looking at you,
I feel like I'm emotional
Watching our love go
stupid-crazy fast
until we lost control
Could you stay right by my side
one more time just to try?
What if we could have been
so much more than this was?
Pretend you're mine
for the night
before I say goodbye
What if we could have been
so much more than this was?
Yeah, we could have made up
Yeah, we should have stayed up
tryna fix this love
'Cause all I that I know is
coulda/shoulda never really
worked for us
Can we get back momentum?
'Cause I can feel the tension
Do you feel it too?
Yeah, I've been up late
and second-guessing,
reminiscing 'bout us two
Could you stay right by my side
one more time just to try?
What if we could have been
so much more than this was?
Pretend you're mine
for the night
before I say goodbye
What if we could have been
so much more than this was?
Was it only young love?
Was I out of my mind?
Did we really mess up?
Can we press rewind?
What if we could have been
so much more than this was?

Was I out of my mind?
